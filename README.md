**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of a control system for a 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) exoskeleton robot system. The control system is designed to regulate the system's behavior and achieve desired performance in the presence of external perturbations.

**Block Diagram**

The control system consists of the following blocks:

1. **Force Disturbance Block**: This block generates a force disturbance and applies it to the system, allowing for the evaluation of the system's dynamics and response to external perturbations.
2. **Fuzzy Estimator Block**: This block employs fuzzy logic principles to estimate the optimal values of the controller parameters.
3. **Main Controller Block**: This block generates the control signals that are applied to the system, using the estimated optimal controller parameters and the system's current state and error signals as inputs.
4. **5-DOF Robot System Block**: This block represents the physical implementation of the proposed 5-DOF robot system.
5. **Control Signals Block**: This block plots the control signals and system outputs over time, demonstrating the control system's performance.

**Key Features**

* The control system is designed to regulate the system's behavior and achieve desired performance in the presence of external perturbations.
* The fuzzy estimator block uses fuzzy logic principles to approximate the optimal values of the controller parameters.
* The main controller block generates the control signals that are necessary to drive the system towards the desired behavior.
* The control signals tend to zero as the system reaches its desired state, indicating that the control system has successfully achieved its objectives.

**Results**

The results of the control system's performance are plotted in the following diagram, which shows the control signals and system outputs over time. The diagram demonstrates that the control system has successfully achieved its objectives, and the results are in complete agreement with the outputs shown in the manuscript.

**Usage**

To use this repository, simply clone it and run the simulation. The results will be plotted in the diagram, demonstrating the control system's performance.
